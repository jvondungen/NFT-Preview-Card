## Overview
Create a simple preview card that changed on hover. The layout and design elements were mostly simple, but the hover portion proved challenging. I was able to work through it and get it close to the design. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I started with HTML, which was fairly simple, although I did have to go back and add some `<div>` and `<span>` elements to get the color differences and hover changes to work. Following this, I worked in my stylesheet to give the design some love. This all went well until I reached the hover portion. Here I struggled quite a bit, but finally was able to get it working.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learned to add hover effects, that dimmed an image and overlayed an icon on top. I used absolute positioning and opacity to obtain the effect.


### Continued development

I'd like to work on more hover effects and positioning. I used percentages, rather than exact x/y position, since I did not have the figma files.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
